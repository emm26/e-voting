# E-Voting

The following project is contextualized in the Software Engineering course at Lleidaâ€™s University, more specifically, the goal is to achieve a simple but effective representation of an electronic voting system. 

The main focus, however, is the creation of tests and the implementation of the code that passes these tests by combining and balancing the knowledge of SOLID principles, GRASP patterns and avoiding code smells.
